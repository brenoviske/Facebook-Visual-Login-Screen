Hello everyone.
This is a visual prototype of facebook login page , made by using both languages , HTML and CSS.
The main intuition behind the making of this screen  was to train evem more my frontend skills, testing new features and configurations , mainly in CSS.
I hope you all can like it and learned something from it in your coding journey.
Thanks.
